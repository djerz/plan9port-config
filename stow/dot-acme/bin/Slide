#!/usr/bin/env rc

# Loads "slide" file given by argument from the current dir
# (the first slide in ./index is loaded if there is no arg)

# Calling this Slide script will modify the filename in the
# the current window's tag to the specified file, clear the
# current window's contents and get the new file's contents

# This should be run in a slideshow directory that contains:
# - plain text files to be used as slides
# - a file named index containing filenames of plain text
#   files from the same directory in the sequence they
#   should appear in the slideshow with one file per line
#   and no empty lines

# Example slideshow directory structure:
#    .
#    ├── body
#    ├── conclusion
#    ├── index
#    └── introduction

# Example index file contents:
#    introduction
#    body
#    conclusion
