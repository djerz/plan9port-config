# Show recently opened files, from least to most recent

# Usage: Arecentf [numfiles] [cachefile]
#     numfiles is the number of file paths to show (default: 20)
#     cachefile is the cache file path (default: ~/.acme/recentf)
# The cache file should contain one file path per line, with the
# oldest accessed file at the top and newest at the bottom.
# Duplicates are ok (handled by the script).
