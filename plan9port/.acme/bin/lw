# List Acme windows, specifically each window's ID, whether it is a
# directory, whether the window is dirty, and the name of the window.
# Inspired by: https://github.com/mpl/lw

# Note that in Acme a similar result can be achieved using the
#    Edit X
# Sam command which lists the windows and their dirty status, but not
# window IDs and if the window corresponds to a directory or file.
