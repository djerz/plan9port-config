# Continually log Acme file opens to ~/.acme/recentf or specified
# file, creating the parent and ancestor directories if needed.

# ~/.acme/recent will contain one line per file open, with the oldest
# at the top and the newest at the bottom. Duplicates are not removed.

# On POSIX systems, it is safe to have multiple instances of this
# script (e.g., when running multiple instances of Acme across
# different namespaces) appending ('>>') to the same file when
# messages are sufficiently short. See following links for details:
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/346062/concurrent-writing-to-a-log-file-from-many-processes
# https://www.notthewizard.com/2014/06/17/are-files-appends-really-atomic/

# Usage: Blog [<path-to-cache-file>]

set -e

RECENTFILE=${1:-$HOME/.acme/recentf}
RECENTFILEDIR=$(dirname "$RECENTFILE")

# Create parent directory of cache file if needed
mkdir -p "$RECENTFILEDIR"

# Note that plan9port grep does not buffer the output by default
# when reading from stdin and specifying a -b flag will make it buffer
# output instead (opposite of the behavior when reading from a file),
# so plan9port grep is called without the -b flag here. See
# https://github.com/9fans/plan9port/blob/master/src/cmd/grep/main.c#L88-L93
